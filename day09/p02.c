//run time variables: memory location of these variables is decided

//			: c99 alloows to define these variables anywhere inside the block.
// auto		: auto variables are created on stack.
//			: they are visible within the block where they are defined.
//			: formal parameters are also auto variables.
//			: when auto variables are created stack grows.
//			: auto is default storage class within a block.
//			: stack shrinks at the end of block and auto variables are destroyed.
// register	: register variables are also run time variables.
//			: traditionaly they are stored in cpu registers.
//			: the c standard says register variables should be located 
//			: in available fastest access memory area.
//			: it may be cpu register, cache memory.
//			: if fastes access memory is not available, they are 
//			: just auto varaibles
//			: register variables are usually used as counters.
//compile time variables: the memory location is decided at compile time.
//			: their life ends when the process exits.
//			: they are located in data section.
//			: default value is zero.
// static	: static variables are visible inside the block or module
//			: where they are defined. they retain value after end of
//			: block
// extern	: extern variables (referred as global variables)
//			: they are visible across all modules in the program.
//			: extern variables are defined once but can be declared
//			: multiple times.

//functions : have default extern scope.
//			: to hide the function from other modules use static keyword.
